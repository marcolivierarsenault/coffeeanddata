_TLDR:_ I build data teams.  

I am a Data Developement leader @ Shopify. I lead a team of Analytic Engineers that are building the best possible data warehouse for Shopify's Data Scientists. After multiple year as a Data Scientist. I have pivoted to the data engineer side of things. Where I can build great assets that scale with the company business needs and data needs. 

At the end of the day, nothing we build is about data and/or technology. It is about real world problems and real world humains.
