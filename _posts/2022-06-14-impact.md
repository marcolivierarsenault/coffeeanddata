When and How to say no  
Internal presentation I made at Shopify earlier this year.

<!--more-->

Earlier this year, I remade a presentation that I did in 2019 at the RnD Summit in Ottawa. RnD Summit is an internal event where all RnD meet have we present content to each other. Something like a technical conference, internal to Shopify.

I wanted to share this publicly because I think that, while this was targeted at data scientists at Shopify, it is pretty accurate for a lot of data scientists out there. So without too much bell and whistle, here it is.

Beforeâ€¦ Here is a little Shopify dictionary for some of the terms. 
- **Merchants**: Shopify main customers, Those are the merchants that use Shopify to do business. 
- **Fecta**: Group of key craft that steer and build a product. Usually includes a mix of Product, Engineering, UX, Data, Marketing and support. 
- **GSD**: [GSD](https://shopify.engineering/running-engineering-program-guide) (or Get Shit Done) is the internal framework on how we do and ship project 
- **Vault**  Internal tool/intranet where all the GSD project lives
- **Burst** in person events (since we are all remote) where we meet to deliver projects and build human connections.

Also, small disclaimer, Given I wanted to share this video publicly, I made sure to build a completely fake example in the communication section of the video. The numbers and chronology are completely random.
