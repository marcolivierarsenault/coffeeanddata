Update on [“Warning systems on data warehouse”](warning-systems-on-data-warehouse)


<!--more-->

Very short post today, I just wanted to share a personal update.

After I created Whistleblower in 2020 as a Warning system on data warehouse. I officially have managed to handover the project to our data infrastructure team. The Data Eng team is way more qualified than me to manage a software like this. That being said, I am very happy to see that this personal project was useful enough to be an integral part of Shopify Data tooling. 

In retrospect, in almost 18 months, the tool has sent more than **30 THOUSAND warnings** to Shopify staff. There were around 200 rules created in the system. 

To me this is an amazing achievement, I managed to support this software over some personal time, evening etc. 

**A few lesson learned during that journey**:
- Don’t name something Whistleblower because you think it is funny. Over 18 months, I received countless messages from people completely scared, who thought they were breaking the law. I renamed the tool to avoid all that useless stress on the team.  

- My empathy level for developers is way higher. I never imagined how much was required “just to keep the lights on”. Updating libraries because there is a security update or simply to keep up with the stack. Breaking changes, etc. So much more respect for the developers after going through this.  

- Tooling for developers at Shopify is amazing. The amount of stuff that was just automagic for me as an app owner was very impressive, I understand why there are so many developers excited to join Shopify.  

- The knowledge I got from this experience is actually useful. Basic Ruby and Rails turn out to be very useful when I need to understand how data is generated in our app (Shopify) given that most of it are in Ruby.  


**Conclusion after this**, don’t limit yourself, you don’t need to be a X to do Y. Of course a dev would have done a better job, faster, fewer bugs and everything. But, I did it, I managed to build a tool that turned out to be useful for enough people so Shopify would adopt it. 

_Thank you data infrastructure team_, you can now take care of it for me. <br/><br/>
